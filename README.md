## What is this?
Allows admins to change a users password manually without the need to send an email to the client and reset it that way.

## How it works?

When this addon is activated, administrators get the ability to change individual user passwords without the need to send a password reset email to the client. You can generate a password or enter one of your choosing.

There are a number of configuration optons available, please see the Configuration heading below.

## How do I install this?

1. Download the latest release from the releases section.

2. Copy the ```modules``` folder to your root WHMCS directory.

3. Navigate to **System Settings > Addon Modules** and click **Activate** beside  **Client Password Changer**.

4. Configure the addon as needed, it will then be available through **Addons >  Client Password Changer** 

## How to update

Simply copy the modules folder into the root of your WHMCS folder accepting any overwrites. I'd recommend keeping the module enabled to preserve your cofiguration settings.
